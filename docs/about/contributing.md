Do you have written your own script and want to share it? Spotted an error and want to fix it? Great.

This page and its source are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcelbrueckner/paperless.sh).
To add new or edit existing pages simply head over to GitHub an create a PR. Existing pages have an edit button next to their title which will take you to the exact source of that page on GitHub.

You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Different scripts, using different languages or dependencies for solving the same problem may still serve the needs of someone better than the existing ones.

Of course, if you think something should be natively supported by Paperless-ngx, the maintainers surely appreciate any PRs, too.
Make sure to check [Paperless-ngx's contribution guidelines](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) before.
